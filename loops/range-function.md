# Range Function

The range function returns an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops. The syntax for the range function is `range([start,] stop[, step]) `, with start defaulting to 0 and step defaulting to 1.

```
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)    # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
```
