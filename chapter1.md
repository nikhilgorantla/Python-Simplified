# Basic Python Syntax 

### Comments

A comment starts with a hash character \(\#\) that is not part of a string literal, and ends at the end of the physical line.

```
# This is a comment
```

### Print

The print function prints objects to standard output or to a text stream.

```
# This script demonstrates a Python print statement.
print
(
"Hello gitbook!"
)
```

### Exit

The exit function exits from Python.

```
exit
()
```
