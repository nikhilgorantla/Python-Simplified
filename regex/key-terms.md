# Key Terms

* **brittle code**
  * Code that works when the input data is in a particular format but is prone to breakage if there is some deviation from the correct format. We call this “brittle code” because it is easily broken.
* **greedy matching**
  * The notion that the “+” and “\*” characters in a regular expression expand outward to match the largest possible string.
* **grep**
  * A command available in most Unix systems that searches through text files looking for lines that match regular expressions. The command name stands for "Generalized Regular Expression Parser".
* **regular expression**
  * A language for expressing more complex search strings. A regular expression may contain special characters that indicate that a search only matches at the beginning or end of a line or many other similar capabilities.
