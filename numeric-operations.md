# **Numeric Operations         **

All numeric types \(except complex\) support the following operations, sorted by ascending priority.

```
a = 3
b = 2

print(a + b)     # 5
print(a - b)     # 1
print(a * b)     # 6
print(a / b)     # 1.5
print(a // b)    # 1
print(a % b)     # 1
print(-a)        # -3
print(a ** b)    # 9
```
