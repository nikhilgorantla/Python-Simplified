body

The sequence of statements within a compound statement.

[\[29\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-29)

boolean expression

An expression whose value is either True or False.

[\[30\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-30)

branch

One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement.

[\[31\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-31)

chained conditional

A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches.

[\[32\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-32)

comparison operator

One of the operators that compares its operands ==,Â !=, &gt;,&lt;&gt;=, and &lt;=[\[33\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-33)

conditional statement

A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition.

[\[34\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-34)

condition

The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch is executed.

[\[35\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-35)

compound statement

A statement that consists of a header and a body. The header ends with a colon \(\). The body is indented relative to the header.

[\[36\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-36)

guardian pattern

Where we construct a logical expression with additional comparisons to take advantage of the short-circuit behavior.

[\[37\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-37)

logical operator

One of the operators that combines boolean expressions and, or, and not.

[\[38\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-38)

nested conditional

A conditional statement that appears in one of the branches of another conditional statement.

[\[39\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-39)

traceback

A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an exception occurs.

[\[40\]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditions#cite_note-40)

short circuit

When Python is part-way through evaluating a logical expression and stops the evaluation because Python knows the final value for the expression without needing to evaluate the rest of the expression.
